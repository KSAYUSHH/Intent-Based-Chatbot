**Intent based Chatbot**
This repository provides an intent-based chatbot that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to identify user intents and deliver relevant responses. The chatbot is designed to handle various user queries by classifying them into predefined intents and mapping them to appropriate actions. The system includes features like customizable intents and responses, allowing developers to easily expand its capabilities. It also integrates entity recognition, enabling the extraction of important details such as dates, locations, or product names from user inputs. This helps improve the chatbot's understanding and provides more contextually accurate replies. Additionally, the chatbot supports API integrations, allowing it to fetch real-time data from external services like weather, news, or customer databases. With multilingual support, the chatbot can cater to users from different linguistic backgrounds, providing a global reach. The user interface is intuitive and interactive, ensuring a seamless experience for users, regardless of their technical knowledge.
**Technologies Used**


**Natural Language Processing:** The chatbot uses NLP libraries like spaCy or NLTK for text preprocessing and intent recognition.


**Machine Learning:** Intents are classified using machine learning models built with frameworks like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or Rasa. These models are trained to improve the chatbot's accuracy and performance over time.

Database: The chatbot uses databases like SQLite or MySQL to store intents, responses, user data, and chatbot configurations

**Features
Intent Classification:** The chatbot utilizes NLP models to accurately classify user inputs into predefined intents. This helps in mapping each user query to a corresponding action or response, ensuring that the chatbot understands the user’s needs effectively.

**Customizable Intents and Responses:** Easily extend the chatbot's capabilities by adding new intents and defining responses. This customization feature allows developers to tailor the chatbot for a wide variety of use cases, such as customer support, FAQs, and more.

**Entity Recognition:** Alongside intent classification, the chatbot is capable of extracting key entities from the user's message. This enables the chatbot to understand and act on specific details within the input, such as dates, locations, product names, and other vital information.

**API Integration:** The chatbot can be integrated with external APIs to fetch real-time data and enhance the conversation. Examples include weather updates, news articles, or customer account details. This makes the chatbot more interactive and useful across different domains.

**Multilingual Support:** Designed to cater to a global audience, the chatbot supports multiple languages, ensuring broader accessibility and communication.

**Interactive UI:** A user-friendly interface provides a seamless experience for users to interact with the chatbot. It’s built to be intuitive, ensuring that even non-technical users can use it with ease.
